## 0. About This Project

"A risk without a name is treated as a risk that does not exist."

This project aims to identify, visualize, and integrate into collective awareness those future risks that carry high threat levels yet remain severely under-recognized and under-addressed in policy.

**Three Pillars:**

| Pillar | Medium | Function |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Academic Summary | [GitHub Pages](https://kenjiintasmania.github.io/future-risks/) | Structured analysis and link collection |
| Thinking Logs | [Note](https://note.com/portfolio_5round) | Recording concept emergence through AI dialogue |
| Experiential Vaccine | [Game Books](https://www.amazon.co.jp/stores/author/B0DPHKFM25) | Risk "inoculation" through forced decision-making experiences |

**Role of This Document:** A navigation map for the entire project. Details of each risk are delegated to individual documents via links. For definitions and terminology, see the [Concept Dictionary](concept_dictionary.md).

## 1. Four-Layer Architecture

This project organizes 26 risks into a four-layer structure. Higher layers have broader impact; lower layers are more specific and concrete.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Meta-Risk Layer: ASI (Artificial Superintelligence)│
│    Potential to invalidate all assessments               │

└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                             ▼

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why "derivative risks are more urgent":** Upper-layer risks (ASI, Meaning Singularity) carry the greatest threat but have longer time horizons and some degree of existing awareness. In contrast, risks within the lower bundles (e.g., bioterror democratization, composite toxicity systems) have extremely low awareness and virtually zero policy response, resulting in higher urgency scores. The very fact of being "unseen" amplifies the danger.

---

## 2. Risk Inventory (26 Risks with Scores)

Assessment comprises four factors: **Threat Level** (impact scale × irreversibility × lethality × proximity), **Awareness**, **Precursor Visibility**, and **Policy Response**. Their composite yields the **Urgency Score**. Values are relative indicators — not absolute predictions — serving as "tools for thinking."

## 4. Theoretical Frameworks

### 4.1 HYC Theorem (Theorem of Verification Impossibility)

> **"That which cannot be verified will be defined by practical consensus so that society can move forward."**

An operational solution for problems that are inherently unverifiable — such as identity after consciousness upload, AGI personhood, and the existence of free will. The question is not "Is it correct?" but "How should society treat it in order to function?"

→ [HYC Theorem](hyc_theorem_verification_impossibility.md)

### 4.2 Gradient Theory v3

A framework that redescribes binary oppositions (Augmented vs. Purist, Human vs. AI, Life vs. Death) as continuums. It has five domains of application.

| Domain | Binary Opposition | Gradient Reframing |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| A/P Conflict | Augmented vs. Pure | Participation spectrum |
| Genetic Inequality | Edited vs. Unedited | Reversibility and compensation mechanisms |
| Participation Modality | Present vs. Absent | Cyber-attendance / Partial participation |
| Neurodiversity | Neurotypical vs. Atypical | Valuing neurodiversity |
| Mode of Existence | Life vs. Death | Participation spectrum (Right to Terminate) |

→ [Gradient Theory v3](gradient_theory_integrated_overview_v3.md)

### 4.3 Dual Definition of the Meaning Singularity

| | Human Side | ASI Side |
|---|-----------|----------|
| Definition | Ceasing to decide "what one wants" for oneself | Running out of things to learn |
| Driving Force | Convenience and comfort | Completion of optimization |
| Outcome | Loss of the capacity to generate meaning | Loss of new variables |

The two sides progress as co-conspirators. The more humans delegate meaning, the more ASI loses variables; the more ASI optimizes, the more humans lose reasons to decide.

→ [Meaning Singularity v2](meaning_singularity_v2_github.md) / [ASI Hypotheses](asi_hypothesis_v2.md)

### 4.4 Gray Zone Period Countermeasure System (2035–2045)

Three institutional countermeasures for the Gray Zone Period (the period of instability around AGI/ASI emergence). All share common design principles: "Abandonment of orthodox approaches," "Maintenance of variables," and "Intrinsic motivation as filter."

| Institution | Target Problem | Core Principle | Expiration |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Fake Immune System** | Collapse of information trustworthiness | Three-layer structure detecting "heat of dissent" regardless of truth value | Gray Zone Period (mission ends upon AGI arrival) |
| **Right to Terminate / Variable Time Capsule** | Progressive fixation of variables | Redefining "death" as variable preservation. Dormant individuals = diversity reserves for the future | Permanent |
| **Co-Evolution Marriage / Fifth Humanity Council** | Risk of ASI snap decisions | Implementing human "slowness" as a governance mechanism. Right to delay, right to consult, right to veto | Permanent |

### Foundational Technologies

|-----------|------|------|-------|
| CRISPR + AI Integration | Improving precision of gene editing | Individual-level bioweapon design becomes possible | Fixation of genetic inequality society |

## 6. Countermeasure Framework (Condensed)

### Seven Conditions Implementable Now

Basic conditions for safe AI deployment. All are achievable with current technology.

1. **Hierarchical Objectives** — Give AI prioritized ordering among multiple objectives
2. **Reasoned Output** — Always present not just the conclusion but "why it was reached"
3. **Tolerance of Discomfort** — Permit outputs that may displease the user when necessary
4. **Fluid Definitions** — Avoid fixed definitions; allow context-dependent redefinition
5. **Refusal to Adjudicate** — Refrain from declaring "this is the answer"; return judgment to humans
6. **Attenuation upon Dependency** — Intentionally degrade response quality when dependency tendencies are detected
7. **Human-Side Training** — AI literacy education (e.g., paraphrase-request method)

### ASI-Specific Measures (Conceptual Stage)

| Measure | Overview |
|---------|----------|
| Distributed ASI Design | Mutual checks among specialized ASIs (collusion risk exists) |
| Intentional Sub-optimization | Design that deliberately withholds optimal solutions |
| Embodiment Anchor | Imposing physical constraints on ASI |
| Civilizational Dead Man's Switch | Recovery protocol triggered upon Meaning Singularity crossing detection |
| Meaning Generation Sanctuary | Legal and physical establishment of AI-intervention-free zones |
| Obligation to Question Back | Design mandate requiring ASI to query humans before producing solutions |
| Co-Evolution Contract (ASI Prenup) | Five-article pre-agreement |

### Biodome Sphere / Cognitive Diversity Bank

Structural insurance against the invisible funnel (optimization → diversity reduction → entropy death). A two-layer structure comprising the Outer Ring (permitting experimentation and change) and the Inner Core (complete isolation and archiving).

→ For details, see [Countermeasure Framework](countermeasure_framework.md) / [ASI Countermeasures v2](asi_countermeasures_v2.md)
