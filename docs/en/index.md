# Under-Recognized Future Risks

**7 Existential Risks That Lack Sufficient Visibility**

---

## About This Project

This project identifies and analyzes major risks facing humanity that are not yet adequately recognized, visualized, or addressed through policy. Through structured dialogue with AI, we develop frameworks for understanding these risks and potential mitigation strategies.

**Approach**: "Smuggling" critical ideas into the future—archiving analyses so they can be discovered when needed.

## The 7 Risks

### 1. [Augmented vs Purist Conflict](./augmented-vs-purist/overview.md) 🔥

The risk of societal division and asymmetric warfare over human enhancement technologies.

```
Threat Level:    High (82.75 / 100)      ■■■■■■■■□□
Recognition:     Very Low (2.5 / 10)     ■■□□□□□□□□
Precursor Level: Moderate (5.5 / 10)     ■■■■■□□□□□
Policy Response: Almost None (1.5 / 10)  ■□□□□□□□□□
```

| A vs P Conflict | 82.75 | 2.5 | 5.5 | 1.5 | 52 |
| Meme Weapons | 79.25 | 4.5 | 5.2 | 2.5 | 46 |
| Microplastics | 77.5 | 2.8 | 5.0 | 1.5 | 54 |
| BCI Hacking | 73.5 | 3.0 | 6.8 | 1.5 | 51 |
| AI Epistemology | 70.25 | 6.0 | 5.8 | 3.5 | 31 |
| Quantum Crypto | 64.5 | 5.5 | 4.5 | 3.0 | 25 |
